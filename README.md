# Coputational neurobiology

## assign 
'assign' files are the matlab codes that I have used to prove the simularity between the functions and show the shape of it.

## fig 6.6 & fig 6.7 
This Figs 6.6 and 6.7 are from the Computational Neuroscience Lecture Notes for AMS 332 by professor G.LaCamera

This matlab code shows the simulation of LIF neuron driven by a spike train

By changing values of 'delta_input'(two options for post-synaptic current) and 'lambda'(represting the input firing rate), we can get different types of results like below
