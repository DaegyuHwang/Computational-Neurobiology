## assign 
'assign' files are the matlab codes that I used to prove the simularity between the functions and show the shape of it.

## fig 6.6 & fig 6.7 
This matlab code shows the simulation of LIF neuron driven by a spike train
This Figs 6.6 and 6.7 are from the Computational Neuroscience Lecture Notes for AMS 332 by professor G.LaCamera
By changing values of 'delta_input'(two options for post-synaptic current) and 'lambda'(represting the input firing rate), we can get different types of results like below
