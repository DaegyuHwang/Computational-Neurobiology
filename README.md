## Coputational neurobiology
I have done all of these works under professor G.LaCamera while studying Computational Neuroscience.

## assign 
'assign' files are the matlab codes that I have used to show the dynamics of spike trains and some parameters to confirm their patterns.

## fig 6.6 & fig 6.7 
This matlab code shows the simulation of LIF neuron driven by a spike train

By changing values of 'delta_input'(two options for post-synaptic current) and 'lambda'(represting the input firing rate), we can get different types of results like below
