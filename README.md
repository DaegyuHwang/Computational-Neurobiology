## assign 
'assign' files are the matlab codes that I have used to show the dynamics of spike trains and some parameters to confirm their patterns.

## fig 6.6 & fig 6.7 
This Figs 6.6 and 6.7 are from the Computational Neuroscience Lecture Notes for AMS 332 by professor G.LaCamera

This matlab code shows the simulation of LIF neuron driven by a spike train

By changing values of 'delta_input'(two options for post-synaptic current) and 'lambda'(represting the input firing rate), we can get different types of results like below
